# Project 1 

## Brief

Starting from the concept of a pinboard, implement a web page that:

- Is responsive (properly layout for smartphone, tablet, and desktop)
- Allows the user to add and remove elements
- Allows the user to customise elements (i.e. colours, size)
- Allows the switch between two views (at least) (I have attached an image)

*two screen shot of final webpage showing the different views (also add to an image file in project folder)*
